# BattletechMap
A simple unity program that shows the ownership of stars at various dates within the battletech timeline. Uses the Sarna Unified Cartography Kit (SUCK). A hosted version can be found here: https://thegreatpl.github.io/BattletechMap/

The SUCK is a google doc spreadsheet (found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x9bvFqSb4_or8JbvGj2LnezGkChWxEzRPf5FXvjonHE/edit#gid=763006440) which contains the coordinates and faction ownership at various dates of the vast majority of star systems included in Battletech. The Systems and Faction pages have been exported as TSV files (renamed to csv when placed in Resources folder due to Unity's limits) and then loaded in at runtime.
